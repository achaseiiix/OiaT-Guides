Cleaning is by far the best way to make money in One in a Trillion. If you aren't aware what cleaning is, cleaning is the act of adding luck sauce to cleaned dirty eggs and opening them in hopes of obtaining a new egg or making more money than you spent to add luck sauce. 

A single unit of luck sauce is equivalent to one tap in the main game. Dirty eggs are naturally found through egg hunts or gem pops and come with a random amount of luck sauce. You will need to tap a random amount of times to "clean" this egg or spend 1 Yellow Gem to instantly clean it. Once that egg is clean, you can reveal what the egg is. In the reveal stage, the amount of luck sauce you put on the egg before or after cleaning it is transformed into simulated taps. Let's say that you find a dirty egg with 1,000 luck sauce on it. When you reveal that egg, you will get the eggs that you might have gotten if you would have tapped 1,000 times. However, you only get to keep the egg of the highest rarity. So, if after 1,000 luck sauce simulated taps you got 5x 250 eggs, 1x 500 eggs, 1x 1,000 eggs, and 2x 2,500 eggs, you will only get to keep the first 2,500 egg you would have found. 

Cleaning eggs becomes useful due to the fact that **you can spend money to add luck sauce**. For every unit of luck sauce (single simulated tap), it will cost $1.20 of in-game currency. Let me motivate why this is so powerful with an example.

If I add 100,000 luck sauce to a dirty egg, it will cost me $120,000. With 100,000 taps, I have around a 63% chance to get a 1 in 100,000 rarity egg. However, I also have a 32% chance to get a 1 in 250,000 rarity egg. And an 18% chance to get a 1 in 500,000 rarity egg. And a 9.5% chance to get a 1 in 1,000,000 rarity egg. (There are other rarities being exluded here but the point remains the same, they aren't as rare as they seem!) It does not seem unreasonable with these rarities that after opening 10 of these dirty eggs, I would get 1x 1,000,000 egg and 2x 500,000 eggs. Just considering those two egg rarities will give a return in money of **$2,000,000**. To add the luck sauce to those 10 eggs, it would cost **$1,200,000**. This means I would profit **$800,000** just by selling 3 of the 10 eggs!

At this point, I hope you are starting to understand why cleaning eggs is such a good way to make money! It is not that hard to get lucky and increase your wallet substantially! I strongly encourage you to get out and try different luck sauce amounts yourself. It has been proven by a few different people that **every** amount of luck sauce is theoretically profitable up until around $11b per egg. So, as long as you don't put all of your money onto fewer than like 100 eggs, you'll constantly gain money!
