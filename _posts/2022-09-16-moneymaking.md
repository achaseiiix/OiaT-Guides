## Wallet < 500m

In the early stages of the game, your main source of income should come from doing **700k scrambles**. These scrambles are by far one of the most profitable things in the game. Additionally, it only takes 6 Red Gems to play. You will find that money should come quickly. After a few days, you should be ready to move onto the next stage!

I recommend that you resist tap blasts or cleaning at this stage. Dirty eggs are too hard to come by and tap blasts are not profitable. Of course, always use your free tap blasts, but focus on completing eggs with the paid ones.

## Wallet 500m+

With more than 500m in your wallet, you should start transitioning from doing scrambles to focusing on cleaning eggs. I recommend you read my **[Optimal Cleaning Guide]({% post_url 2022-09-16-optimalcleaning %})**. In short, follow cleans using the table below.

When you get lucky from on a clean, you should sell your egg that you get. For example, if you have a wallet of $1b and get a 10b egg from a clean, sell it so that you can start cleaning at the next threshold. You **will** get that egg back eventually! (if you don't go broke) Don't worry.

That's pretty much it! Making money is really simple in this game. Now you should be able to start saving up for new upgrades.
