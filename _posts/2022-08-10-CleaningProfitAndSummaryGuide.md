# Guide to use these Tables
#### The numbers listed in first (A) and third (C) columns are the most important to get started in making money.  As you start out (Below 1b wallet), use the first 2 rows as well as 700k scrambles to make your first billion $.  As you reach each new benchmark (Column C), start using that new amount of luck sauce (Column A). This will help you snowball your money making, and help you reach those OIAT's!

# Notes
### - Cells with asterisks (*) are purely test values, not recommended to use at the moment (though some can work well)
### - 100m and 200m starting wallet are loose recommendations - you can start as early as you want as long as you use 700k scrambles at the same time - they'll make money for your cleans

* Though you may get an unlucky streak, these sauce values ensure the maximum profit over time. Keep using them and you'll profit in the long run

* Selling new eggs once you unlock them (for rarer finds) is a good thing - although if may go against your instincts as a collector, getting a larger wallet will allow you to do larger cleans and you'll get the rare eggs back in the future

* You don't need to save up until your dirty egg storage is full; do as many as you can and sell the eggs you get to do another round. That said, it may feel more satisfying to do them all at once and can feel more consistent since you're more likely to profit from a full batch of cleans

* Average profit per clean is calculated using only eggs with more than a 1/100 (1%) chance of being pulled - the true value is actually higher due to the chance of getting rarer eggs. They're only excluded here to get a more realistic sense of how much you'll be making

* The second table is if they were calculated including eggs with between a 1/100 and 1/1000 chance of being pulled. Similarly to the previous note, this is to give a more realistic sense of how much you would make. Use these numbers if you expect to do more than 400 pulls at the given sauce
To match with this, the newly included cells are gray in the 'Chance of Each Egg' sheet.

* ??? eggs are not accounted for in any way, as the probability to pull them is unknown

* Below or in combination with 1.3/2.5/13m cleans, just do 700k scrambles - they'll make you enough money to start doing higher cleans and are extremely consistent

* You can start using a sauce amount below the recommended (Column B), but keep in mind that it's riskier and you may lose more before you make it back

* With how profitable 700k scrambles are, it may be better to spam those for profit and use your dirty eggs to complete collections at this point. Scrambles begin to become less relevant when using larger amounts of sauce, so consider switching to cleans as your primary money making method once you can do many 13m or 130m cleans

* The values given are the amount of sauce, not the amount of money

* The cost of each clean is the amount of sauce * 1.2

* Recommended wallet values are based on 80 * recommended sauce. This ensures a high chance to get the rarer pulls (1/78 for the "13's", and a couple 1/40's for the "25's"). Note that you get more than 80 pulls with this starting value, as you can sell the eggs you get from the first 80 pulls for more chances. The exception for this is 2.5b and 4.5b, where they're set to aim for a 1t egg at minimum. Don't use these unless you're too rich to care about money, and are just aiming for 1t and ??? eggs.

* The recommended sauce values are from what I've seen generally promoted in the discord chats. The recommended wallet values are my recommendation based on the logic above. 

* Idk the term for it so "Expected Profit" (Column F) is how much you'd expect to multiply your money by if you spent everything doing that clean. Note that this is accounting for the rarer pulls under 1/1000 (1/770, 1/400, etc.) so with a low sample size you may not meet these expected values

* Using these values, I reached around 2.5 trillion net worth and 4 OIAT's in 10 days after starting. As you're only limited by how many dirty eggs you can collect, just keep tapping!
